                  Hi üëã, I`m Fyargat. I`m a Frontend Developer with experience
                  in React, NextJS, and Sass development. Two years of work at{' '}

                  helped me become a professional in creating responsive and
                  creative web applications. Currently, I am freelancing, where
                  I continue to apply and enhance my skills by creating websites
                  that combine creative design with high performance.

                  In addition to frontend development, I am also passionate
                  about backend development. I actively study NodeJS, NestJS,
                  and MongoDB to understand the entire structure of web
                  applications and ensure their quality operation from both
                  sides. Furthermore, I have experience in creating Telegram
                  bots ü§ñ, adding an extra layer of diversity to my knowledge
                  and skills.{' '}

                  In my work, I value attention to detail and a commitment to
                  perfection. I believe in the importance of clean code and good
                  application architecture. My goal is to continue applying new
                  technologies, learning, and growing as a developer, as well as
                  creating products that bring value and joy to users. If you
                  have interesting projects or are looking for a web development
                  specialist, I am always ready for new challenges and
                  collaboration. ‚úâÔ∏è
